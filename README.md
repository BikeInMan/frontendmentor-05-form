## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"[Field Name] cannot be empty"*
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Looks like this is not an email"*

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

1. How to style forms correctly
2. How to display custom validation errors
3. Use of responsive layout techinques
4. How to validate individually and also again on submit

### Continued development

Must improve JavaScript validation logic to make it more simple and concise.


### Useful resources

- [MDN Forms](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/GlobalEventHandlers/oninvalid) - This helped me on how to start on validations in Javascript.
- [MDN Forms Guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms) - Helped me to understand forms in a much deeper sense.
